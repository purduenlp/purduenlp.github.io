# Decision on group project
Based on the doodle voting, we are going to work on "Semantic Textual Similarity". Dr. Dan Goldwasser lead us through the paper ["SemEval-2016 Task 1: Semantic Textual Similarity, Monolingual and Cross-Lingual Evaluation"](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/agirre.semeval16.pdf) and gave us a detailed explanation of this task. I-ta and Mahak will take the ownership of this project to manage the project.

# Teach-me session by María Leonor Pacheco
Group member María gave us a hands-on [tutorial](../_resources/gitflow.pdf) on git-flow, which is really helpful for professional coding.

# What will be in the next meeting?
Group member Pranjal Daga will present ["Probabilistic Soft Logic for Semantic Textual Similarity"](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ml/papers/beltagy.acl14.pdf), and Cosmo will do a teach-me session of "Trello".
